Tired of flipping through endless notes? Want an **interactive** way to test your knowledge?

## 🎯 Why Study Buddy?  

One day, I was grinding through material for a certification exam, and I thought:  
_"There has to be an easier way to study, track progress, and actually learn!"_ 🤯  

So... I built **Study Buddy** – an app that lets you **create** custom flashcards and study in **two powerful ways**:
1. **Multiple Choice Mode** - Get familiar with different answer choices. 🧐  
2. **Open-Ended Mode** - Type your answer, and **OpenAI** will check it & give feedback! 🧠💡  

> "The best way to learn is to test yourself!"
